    "\n",
    "[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two strings `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`. You may return the answer in **any order**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "```code\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"cbaebabacd\", p = \"abc\"\n",
    "Output: [0,6]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The substring with start index = 0 is \"cba\", which is an anagram of \"abc\".\n",
    "The substring with start index = 6 is \"bac\", which is an anagram of \"abc\".\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"abab\", p = \"ab\"\n",
    "Output: [0,1,2]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The substring with start index = 0 is \"ab\", which is an anagram of \"ab\".\n",
    "The substring with start index = 1 is \"ba\", which is an anagram of \"ab\".\n",
    "The substring with start index = 2 is \"ab\", which is an anagram of \"ab\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 10^4`\n",
    "- `s` and `p` consist of lowercase English letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "- When we meet a character `c = s[r]`, we decrease the `cnt[c]` by one by `cnt[c]--`\n",
    "    - If the `cnt[c] < 0`, it means our window contains char `c` with the number more than in `p`, which is invalid.\n",
    "    - So we need to slide left to make sure `cnt[c] >= 0`."
