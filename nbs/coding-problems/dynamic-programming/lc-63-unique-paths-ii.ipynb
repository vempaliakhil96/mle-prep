    "You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include **any** square that is an obstacle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 10^9`.\n",
