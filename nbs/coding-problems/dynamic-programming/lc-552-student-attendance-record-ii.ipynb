    "- `'L'`: Late.\n",

    "The student was absent (`'A'`) for strictly fewer than 2 days **total**.\n",
    "The student was never late (`'L'`) for **3 or more consecutive days**.\n",
    "Given an integer `n`, return the number of possible attendance records of length `n` that make a student eligible for an attendance award. The answer may be very large, so return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n",
