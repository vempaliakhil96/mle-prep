    "[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array if you can flip at most `k` `0`'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "```code\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]\n",
    "Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3\n",
    "Output: 10\n",
    "Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]\n",
    "Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`\n",
    "- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.\n",
    "- `0 <= k <= nums.length`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "- One thing's for sure, we will only flip a zero if it extends an existing window of 1s. Otherwise, there's no point in doing it, right? Think Sliding Window!\n",
    "- Since we know this problem can be solved using the sliding window construct, we might as well focus in that direction for hints. Basically, in a given window, we can never have > K zeros, right?\n",
    "- We don't have a fixed size window in this case. The window size can grow and shrink depending upon the number of zeros we have (we don't actually have to flip the zeros here!)."
