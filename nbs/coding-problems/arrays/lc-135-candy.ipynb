    "You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each child must have at least one candy.\n",
    "- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.\n",
    "- Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: ratings = [1,0,2]\n",
    "Output: 5\n",
    "Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",

    "Input: ratings = [1,2,2]\n",
    "Output: 4\n",
    "Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.\n",
    "The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.\n",
