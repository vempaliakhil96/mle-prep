    "[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-words-formed-by-letters/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a list of `words`, list of  single `letters` (might be repeating) and `score` of every character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum score of **any** valid set of words formed by using the given letters (`words[i]` cannot be used two or more times).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not necessary to use all characters in `letters` and each letter can only be used once. Score of letters `'a', 'b', 'c', ... ,'z'` is given by `score[0], score[1], ... , score[25]` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "```code\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: words = [\"dog\",\"cat\",\"dad\",\"good\"], letters = [\"a\",\"a\",\"c\",\"d\",\"d\",\"d\",\"g\",\"o\",\"o\"], score = [1,0,9,5,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n",
    "Output: 23\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Score  a=1, c=9, d=5, g=3, o=2\n",
    "Given letters, we can form the words \"dad\" (5+1+5) and \"good\" (3+2+2+5) with a score of 23.\n",
    "Words \"dad\" and \"dog\" only get a score of 21.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: words = [\"xxxz\",\"ax\",\"bx\",\"cx\"], letters = [\"z\",\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"x\",\"x\",\"x\"], score = [4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,10]\n",
    "Output: 27\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Score  a=4, b=4, c=4, x=5, z=10\n",
    "Given letters, we can form the words \"ax\" (4+5), \"bx\" (4+5) and \"cx\" (4+5) with a score of 27.\n",
    "Word \"xxxz\" only get a score of 25.\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: words = [\"leetcode\"], letters = [\"l\",\"e\",\"t\",\"c\",\"o\",\"d\"], score = [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Letter \"e\" can only be used once.\n",
