    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-genetic-mutation/)\n",
    "\n",
    "A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we need to investigate a mutation from a gene string `startGene` to a gene string `endGene` where one mutation is defined as one single character changed in the gene string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, `\"AACCGGTT\" --> \"AACCGGTA\"` is one mutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a gene bank `bank` that records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in `bank` to make it a valid gene string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the two gene strings startGene and `endGene` and the gene bank bank, return the minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from startGene to `endGene`. If there is no such a mutation, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "```code\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: startGene = \"AACCGGTT\", endGene = \"AACCGGTA\", bank = [\"AACCGGTA\"]\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: startGene = \"AACCGGTT\", endGene = \"AAACGGTA\", bank = [\"AACCGGTA\",\"AACCGCTA\",\"AAACGGTA\"]\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- `0 <= bank.length <= 10`\n",
    "- `startGene.length == endGene.length == bank[i].length == 8`\n",
    "- `startGene`, `endGene`, and `bank[i]` consist of only the characters `['A', 'C', 'G', 'T']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Just find valid neighbors of the start gene and itereatively do BFS and keep exploring neighbours."
